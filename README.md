# Time_Elapsed_for_TI89
Program that calculates time elapsed between two times written in C and compiled for the TI89

This program was originally written for the purposes of finding the duration of tutoring sessions with students based of the time
of day in which the session begins and ends but can be used in any scenario in which such calculations are neccessary. It was
written in C and then compiled for the TI89 using the GCC4TI IDE. To use this program on your calculator simply send the file
Time_Elapsed.89z to your TI89 and run it by entering the command timeelap() or opening through the var-link button. The program
will promt the user for the neccessary values required and return the time elapsed or an error if the input is errendous. This
program does not work across date lines and must be used with 24 hour time. After the time elapsed is displayed you may press any
key to exit the program. If you wish to use this program with another calculator that is compatible with C the original C source
file can be edited and compiled to meet whatever your needs are.
